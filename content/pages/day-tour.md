          Sri Lanka is world-famous for its tea, and the Upcountry region, where
          Hugging Clouds is located, is known for its lush, scenic tea
          plantations. On this tour, you’ll visit local tea estates where you
          can explore the rolling hills and fields of tea, learn about the
          history of Ceylon tea, and see the tea-picking process firsthand.

          Included:

          A guided tour through one of the local tea plantations.

          An opportunity to observe the intricate tea-picking process and learn
          about the methods of cultivation and processing.

          A tasting session where you can sample fresh, aromatic Ceylon tea.

          This is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in Sri Lanka’s rich tea
          heritage and enjoy the peaceful beauty of the plantations, with views
          stretching across the hills.
