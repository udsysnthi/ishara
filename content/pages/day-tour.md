          **Aberdeen Waterfall** is one of the region’s most peaceful and scenic
          natural wonders. Located near Nuwara Eliya, this waterfall is a place
          where time seems to slow down, and the soft hum of cascading water

          envelop you, creating a sense of calm. As you approach the waterfall,
          the sound of water gently cascading over rocks draws you closer, and
