          **Adam's Peak Sunrise Hike Tour**


          Duration: 5-6 hours (depending on the pace)


          The Adamâ€™s Peak Sunrise Hike is a pilgrimage and a bucket-list
          experience for both spiritual seekers and nature lovers. The hike
          begins in the early hours of the morning, typically around 2:00 AM, so
          you can reach the summit in time for the breathtaking sunrise.


          Included:

          Professional local guide to help you navigate the trail and share
          insights into the history and significance of Adam's Peak.

          Tea and refreshments along the way.

          View of the Sri Pada footprint at the summit, a sacred site for many
          religions.

          A chance to witness the majestic sunrise over the misty mountains, a
          moment that feels both humbling and awe-inspiring.


          The hike is one of the most important religious and cultural journeys
          in Sri Lanka, and Hugging Clouds provides a comfortable and convenient
          base for starting this memorable adventure.
