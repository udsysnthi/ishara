          Hugging Clouds is very practical to reach Adam’s peak entrance.

          The rooms are simple but they have everything you need.

          The food is very good and the breakfast is delicious especially after
          climbing 5640 steps!

          The staff is super helpful, so I would definitely recommend!

          We went on an awesome tour of this beautiful country together with
          Madu - our local guide & driver & feel good expert from Hugging Clouds
          Tours - one of the best experiences of our lives!

          It's impossible to list all the different activities, but here are our
          favorites:

          \- elephant safari (they were so close!)

          \- cooking class Sri Lankan style (delicious!)

          \- Temple of The Tooth at night (perfect timing to see the relic!)

          \- train ride (thanks for the seats, Madu!)

          \- Sigiriya rock fortress (what an incredible view and history)

          \- mega zip line (some adrenaline!)

          \- ... and so much more.

          But the main attractions were only part of the story, because we would
          just stop everywhere to try the local cuisine (fresh fruit, street
          food, coconuts, fresh roasted peanuts, you name it!). If you saw
          something (moon stone mine 4 km right), he made it possible. If he
          wasn't convinced of something he would tell you. Always on time,
          always 110 % reliable, always smiles, and always knowledgable and fun
          to talk to.

          We arrived from Hatton via Bus and had this amazing view of the
          Nallathanniya area. The Huggin Clouds staff were super friendly and
          helpful. We quickly found a tour through the tea fields, to different
          view spots in high elevation and to the top of a huge waterfall with a
          natural infinity pool (with the possibility to swim) - amazing! The
          entire tour was really spectacular. We were lucky to have auch a nice
          guide who Had so many details around the tea fields, different
          divisions but also about the different religions. Thanks for a great
          day, would definitely recommend.

          Our stay at Hugging Clouds was fantastic. The 500m proximity to Adam’s
          peak made it the perfect start point for the trek up.

          What really made our stay at Hugging Clouds was the service. Madu took
          us on a waterfall trekking tour. We drove through a tea plantation
          estate and Madu answered all of our questions about tea harvesting and
          manufacturing. We walked through tea crops and across another
          waterfall to get to the top of Gartmore falls for a swim. It was such
          a great day because of his hospitality.

          Would highly recommend staying at Hugging Clouds and going on the
          waterfall tour with Madu!
